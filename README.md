# Udacity-Test-a-Perceptual-Phenomenom
Project 5, Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree

***

## Description
In this project, I investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. I learned about the experiment, created a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then went through the task. I then looked at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and computed some statistics describing the results. Finally, I interpreted my results in terms of my hypotheses.

### Responses to Project Questions
| CRITERIA                       | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                                       |
| ------------------------------ |----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Question 1: Identify variables in the experiment          | Q1: Question response correctly identifies the independent and dependent variables in the experiment. |
| Question 2a: Establish hypotheses  | Q2a: Null and alternative hypotheses are clearly stated in words and mathematically. Symbols in the mathematical statement are defined. |
| Question 2b: Establish a statistical test   | Q2b: A statistical test is proposed which will distinguish the proposed hypotheses. Any assumptions made by the statistical test are addressed. |
| Question 3: Report descriptive statistics   | Q3: Descriptive statistics, including at least one measure of centrality and one measure of variability, have been computed for the datasetâ€™s groups. |
| Question 4: Plot the data  | Q4: One or two visualizations have been created that show off the data, including comments on what can be observed in the plot or plots.   |
| Question 5: Perform the statistical test and interpret your results   | Q5: A statistical test has been correctly performed and reported, including test statistic, p-value, and test result. The test results are interpreted in terms of the experimental task performed. Alternatively, students may use a bootstrapping approach to simulate the results of a traditional hypothesis test.   |
| Question 6: Digging deeper and extending the investigation Question 6 is optional and does not need to be answered in order to meet project specifications.   | Q6: Hypotheses regarding the reasons for the effect observed are presented. An extension or related experiment to the performed Stroop task is provided, that may produce similar effects.  |
